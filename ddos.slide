DoS

* Denial of Service

An attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.

*Symptoms*

- Unusually slow network performance (opening files or accessing web sites)
- Unavailability of a particular web site
- Inability to access any web site
- Dramatic increase in the number of spam emails received (e-mail bomb)
- Disconnection of a wireless or wired internet connection
- Long term denial of access to the web or any internet services

* Attack Techniques

* ICMP Flood

Malformed ICMP packets aimed at consuming targets network and computational resources.

*Smurf*attack*

Intended victim's spoofed source IP are broadcast to a computer network using an IP broadcast address.

*Ping*of*death*

Sending malformed/malicious ping to a computer
e.g. a ping that is bigger than max IPv4 message (65,535 bytes)

*Ping*flood*

Constantly sending pings, without waiting for a response, consuming bandwidth.

* SYN Flood

Sending multiple SYN request to a target's system without responding to ACK, so the target queues them all awaiting a timeout on the request.

* TCP three-way handshake (normal)

* SYN Flood

* Teardrop Attack

Sending overlapping IP fragments to a target, exploiting an overlapping IP fragment bug.

Causes the TCP/IP fragmentation re-assembly code to improperly handle overlapping IP fragments. 

* RUDY (R-U-Dead-Yet?)

"Low and slow" attack

- Browses the target website and detects embedded web forms
- Sends legitimate HTTP POST request with an abnormally long 'content-length' header field
- Send the content in small chunks and at a very low rate

Eventually, the number and length of open sessions exhaust the targetâ€™s resources.

The opposite: Slow read attack

* PDoS (Phlashing)

Targets hardware

- Exploits security flaws which allow remote administration of hardware, such as routers, printers, etc.
- Uses exploits to replace a device's firmware (flashing / bricking)

* Distributed Denial of Service

An attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.

* Easy to make one, yet highly effective

- $150 can buy a week-long DDoS attack on the black market. 
- 1/3 of all downtime incidents are attributed to DDoS attacks.

* Github DDoS

.image githubddos.png 300 _ 

A obfuscated JS silently injected into the traffic of sites that use an analytics service from Baidu that forces their browser to constantly reload the two targeted GitHub pages:

- [[https://github.com/greatfire]]
- [[https://github.com/cn-nytimes]]

* Slashdot effect

Popular website links to a smaller site, causing a massive increase in traffic.

Generally related to the dynamic part of the site (db, app etc.)

"Reddit hug of death"
