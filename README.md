brownbag
========

The slides and example codes from my brownbag session about Go language on 7 Jan 2015

To view presentation, first you need to have Go installed on your computer.

Once it is installed and set up correctly, run go get `code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/present` on a terminal.

Then, download the contents of this repository and run `present` on that folder. If it is successfully initialized without any custom parameters, the slide itself should now be accessible via http://127.0.0.1:3999/golang.slide link.
